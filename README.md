School/Side Projects

I've included some of my school projects, but I am currently working on
converting an ASP.Net assignment into an MVC implementation.

I will include the original project description in the project. I will be doing
part of this project for a grade this month, so general guidance would be
appreciated, but place don't include exact how-to help. Figuring out is
where the fun is after all.

Thanks for visiting!

Now to start, I am trying to figure out how to simulate a ListView in MVC. This
ListView is supposed to add Customer information on button click. This "ListView"
should also be able to delete contact names and clear the contact list (both on
button click).

Only administrators should be able to have a contact list. (Not customers or
  technicians). Administrators should be logged in to access their contact
  information. Contacts are added through the Customer/Index controller.

I am hoping to do this using a model, a partial view with a border, and buttons
linked to Crud operations.

Made progress on creating the code for CustomerList to store Contacts, but will need to use session state. Need to research using session state with MVC. Also need to figure out how to properly implement navbar-invert with a footer in current bootstrap. Currently goes black, but color stays black. Also still working on properly implementing a partial view. Space depicts it exists, but the partial view is not rendering (text, outline).
