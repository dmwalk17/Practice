I figured it out. I was using a trim method inside an empty method
on my display conditionals and as of Php5.5, the empty method will only take a 
variable. From what I can tell, it automatically 
does a trim, so it worked ok without it. My apache ran the stacked methods
anyway, but the school server wouldn't render it.
